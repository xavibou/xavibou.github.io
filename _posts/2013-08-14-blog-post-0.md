A review of RobustNet, a Domain Generalization method for Urban-Scene Semantic Segmentation. Instead of exposing the network to a wide range of domains, RobustNet tries to separate domain-variant from domain-invariant features via a whitening transformation. A demo is provided to easily test RobustNet and see the results on your own data.
